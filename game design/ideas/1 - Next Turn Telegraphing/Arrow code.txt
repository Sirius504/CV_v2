Four arrows, that change color, being enabled/disabled

Where arrow gonna exist?
Arrow's will be attached not to entities' prefabs, but tiles.

How arrows are gonna know where to appear?
Arrows are gonna me preinstantiated inbetween of all tiles and disabled.
Manager is going to collect all "next action" info from all enemies,
and enable corresponding arrows, then pass these actions into each.

Plan
	0. Create Next Turn Info Manager class, that is responsible for handling arrows.
	1. Calculate amount of arrows and it's positions depending on level size.
	2. Create class "Action Info" with info about entity's next action.
	3. Figure out the order, when telegrapher is going to update.
	4. Create "Next Turn Tile Info" prefab (layout group) and class
	5. Create arrow prefab and class
