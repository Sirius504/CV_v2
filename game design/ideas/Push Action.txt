Push Action

Instead of just attacking, player can choose to push enemy away instead.
If a tile enemy is being pushed into is empty, enemy takes no damage.
If enemy is pushed into a wall, he takes one damage, but doesn't change position.
If enemy is pushed into another enemy, they both take one damage, but
don't change positions.
